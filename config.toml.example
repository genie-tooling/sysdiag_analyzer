# Example configuration file for sysdiag-analyzer
# Copy this to /etc/sysdiag-analyzer/config.toml (system-wide)
# or ~/.config/sysdiag-analyzer/config.toml (user-specific)
# User config overrides system config.

# --- LLM Analysis Configuration (Optional) ---
[llm]
# Specify the provider. Currently supported: "ollama"
# provider = "ollama"

# Model name available in your chosen provider instance (e.g., Ollama)
# Required if provider is set.
# model = "llama3:latest"

# --- Ollama Specific Settings (Optional) ---
# Override Ollama API host if not default (http://localhost:11434)
# host = "http://192.168.1.100:11434"

# --- General LLM Generation Parameters (Optional) ---
# temperature = 0.2 # Controls randomness (0.0 = deterministic, >1.0 = more random)
# max_tokens = 1024 # Max number of tokens to generate in the completion
# context_window = 4096 # Model's context window size (informational for some providers)

# --- History Persistence Configuration (Optional) ---
[history]
# Directory to store analysis reports. Requires write permissions.
# directory = "/var/lib/sysdiag-analyzer/history"

# Maximum number of report files to keep. Older files will be deleted.
# max_files = 50

# --- ML Model Configuration (Optional) ---
[models]
# Directory to store trained ML models. Requires write permissions for retrain-ml.
# directory = "/var/lib/sysdiag-analyzer/models"

# Number of historical data points (timesteps) to use in a sequence for the LSTM model.
# A larger value helps the model learn longer-term patterns but requires more data to train.
# Value must be smaller than `min_samples_train`.
# lstm_timesteps = 5

# Minimum number of historical data points required per unit to train a model.
# Must be greater than `lstm_timesteps`.
# min_samples_train = 10
